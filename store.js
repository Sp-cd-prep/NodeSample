        title:"The Shawshank Redemption",
        genre:"Drama",
        description:"The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film that was released in 1994 and directed by Frank Darabont. The movie is based on the novella by Stephen King and tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940s, the film follows Andy's experiences as a prisoner and his eventual escape from the Shawshank State Penitentiary. One of the most striking aspects of the film is the portrayal of prison life. Through the eyes of Andy and his friend Red, played by Morgan Freeman, we see the brutality, violence, and hopelessness that permeate the walls of the prison. We also see the bond that can develop between prisoners and the sense of community that can arise in the most unlikely of places. The film is also a study of the human spirit and the power of hope. Despite his bleak circumstances, Andy remains determined to find a way out of prison and rebuild his life. He refuses to let the system break him, and through his quiet strength, he inspires those around him. Red, who has become institutionalized after decades behind bars, is initially skeptical of Andy's optimism but eventually learns to believe in the power of hope. The performances in the film are outstanding. Tim Robbins delivers a subtle and nuanced portrayal of Andy, conveying his intelligence, strength, and vulnerability. Morgan Freeman's performance as Red is equally impressive, capturing the character's wit, wisdom, and weariness. The supporting cast, which includes the likes of Bob Gunton and William Sadler, also delivers strong performances that help bring the world of the prison to life. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that has stood the test of time. It has resonated with audiences for decades and has become a cultural touchstone. Its themes of hope, friendship, and the human spirit are universal and continue to inspire people around the world. The film is a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring appeal of a great narrative.",

In a distant, but not so unrealistic, future where mankind has abandoned earth because it has become covered with trash from products sold by the powerful multi-national Buy N Large corporation, WALL-E, a garbage collecting robot has been left to clean up the mess.

One day, EVE, a sleek (and dangerous) reconnaissance robot, is sent to Earth to find proof that life is once again sustainable. WALL-E falls in love with EVE. WALL-E rescues EVE from a dust storm and shows her a living plant he found amongst the rubble.

The ship arrives back at a large space cruise ship, which is carrying all of the humans who evacuated Earth 700 years earlier. The people of Earth ride around this space resort on hovering chairs which give them a constant feed of TV and video chatting. They drink all of their meals through a straw out of laziness and/or bone loss, and are all so fat that they can barely move. When the auto-pilot computer, acting on hastily-given instructions sent many centuries before, tries to prevent the people of Earth from returning by stealing the plant, WALL-E, EVE, the portly captain, and a band of broken robots stage a mutiny.",

        title:"Gangs of Wasseypur",
        genre:"Action | Comedy | Crime",
        description:"Prologue In January 2004 , a gang of heavily armed men scour and finally narrow down on a house in Wasseypur. They surround the house and unleash a wave of bullets and grenades on it with the intention of killing the family inside it. After heavy firing on the house, they retreat from the crime scene in a vehicle, convinced they have killed everyone within. The leader of the gang then calls J.P. Singh on his cell phone and reports that the family has been successfully executed but he is double crossed by JP Singh as a fire fight erupts between them and a police check post blocking their escape route. The scene cuts abruptly for a prologue by the narrator, Nasir. The whole scene is then revealed in the sequel. Introduction of Wasseypur and Dhanbad Nasir's narration describes the history and nature of Wasseypur. During the British Raj, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were located in the Bengal region. After India gained its independence in 1947, they were carved out of Bengal and redistricted into the state of Bihar in 1956. In 2000, Wasseypur and Dhanbad were redistricted for a second time into the newly formed state of Jharkhand where they remain. The village has been historically dominated by the Qureshi Muslims, a sub-caste of animal butchers who are feared by the non-Qureshi Muslims living there and Dhanbad by extension. During British colonial rule, the British had seized the farm lands of Dhanbad for coal which began the business of coal mining in Dhanbad. The region was a hotbed of the local faceless dacoit Sultana Qureshi who robbed British trains in the night and thus held some patriotic value for the locals. 1940s In 1941 , Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat), a Pathan, takes advantage of the mysteriousness of the faceless dacoit Sultana, a Qureshi, by impersonating his identity to rob British ferry trains. The Qureshi clans eventually find out and order the banishment of Shahid Khan and his family from Wasseypur. They settle down in Dhanbad where Shahid begins work as a labourer in a coal mine. He is unable to be at his wife's side during childbirth, and she dies. The enraged Shahid kills the coal mine's muscleman who had denied him leave on that day. In 1947, independent India begins to assert its authority over itself. The British coal mines are sold to Indian industrialists and Ramadhir Singh (Tigmanshu Dhulia) receives a few coal mines in the Dhanbad region. He hires Shahid Khan as the new muscleman of one of the coal mines. Shahid terrorises the local population to seize their lands and extract compliance. On a rainy day, Ramadhir Singh overhears Shahid's ambitions of taking over the coal mines from him. Singh tricks Shahid into traveling to Varanasi for business but instead has him murdered by an assassin named Yadav Ji (Harish Khanna). Nasir (Piyush Mishra), Shahid's cousin, finds Ramadhir's umbrella with his initials near the door and concludes that Ramadhir eavesdropped on their conversation. He flees from the house with Shahid's son Sardar in the nick of time as Ehsaan Qureshi (Vipin Sharma), another associate of Ramadhir Singh and a member of the Wasseypur Qureshi clan, shows up to kill them but is too late. An unsuccessful Ehsaan lies to Singh that Shahid's family has been murdered, burnt, and buried. Under the care of Nasir, Sardar grows up along with Nasir's nephew Asgar (Jameel Khan). Sardar learns the truth about his father's death, upon which he shaves his head and vows not to grow his hair until he has avenged his father's murder. Early and Mid 1970s In 1972 , the coal mines are nationalised. A mature Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai) and his kin start hijacking Ramadhir's coal trucks mid-transit. Ramadhir Singh suspects S.P. Sinha, a Coal India official, to be behind the hijackings and has him murdered. After Sinha's murder, Ramadhir's reputation for ruthlessness grows, and he becomes feared in Dhanbad. Sardar marries Nagma Khatoon (Richa Chadda). The pregnant Khatoon confronts Sardar Khan and a prostitute inside a brothel and chases him away. Later, Nagma gives birth to Danish Khan but gets pregnant immediately afterwards. Unable to have sex with a pregnant Nagma, Sardar confesses his sexual frustrations with his kin. At dinner, Nagma gives her consent to Sardar to sleep with other women but with the condition that he won't bring them home or dishonour the family name. Sardar, Asgar and Nasir start working for J.P. Singh (Satya Anand), Ramadhir Singh's son. They misuse their employment by secretly selling the company petrol in the black market. Later, they rob a petrol pump and a train bogey belonging to the Singh family. They usurp Singh's land, which forces the two families to confront each other for talks. The meeting ends in a scuffle, but Ramadhir Singh realizes that Sardar Khan is in fact the son of Shahid Khan who he had murdered in the late 1940s. Sardar and Asgar are jailed for assaulting J.P. Singh during the meeting. Early 1980s In 1979 , Sardar and Asgar escape from jail. While hiding in Wasseypur, Sardar marries a Bengali Hindu woman named Durga (Reema Sen). Asgar informs Nagma that Sardar has taken a second wife, leaving Nagma helpless. Meanwhile, Wasseypur has merged with Dhanbad and the Qureshi clan continues to terrorise the non-Qureshi Muslims. The locals then approach Sardar Khan for help as he was well known for standing up to Ramadhir Singh. During Muharram, both Shias and Sunnis are out mourning, including the Qureshi clan. Sardar uses the opportunity to launch a major bomb attack on many Qureshi shops and houses. When word spreads about Sardar's raids, his reputation grows and he commands more fear than the Qureshi clan. Eventually, Sardar returns home to Nagma and she gets pregnant again. Sardar tries to initiate sex with a pregnant Nagma but she refuses, which prompts an angry Sardar to leave. He goes to stay with his second wife, Durga, and she gives birth to his son, Definite. Ramadhir Singh, noticing that Sardar has abandoned his first family, tries to reach out to Nagma through Danish by giving him money. An enraged Nagma beats Danish for taking the money while she breaks down in front of Nasir. A thirsty Faizal wakes up in the middle of the night to find Nagma and Nasir about to have sex. Angry, he storms out of the house and becomes a stoner, permanently seen with his chillum. Nasir reveals that the desires were never consummated, but Faizal and Nasir never see eye to eye again. Mid and Late 1980s Sensing Sardar's increasing clout, Ramadhir calls his old associate Ehsaan Qureshi who brokers a meeting between Sultan Qureshi(Pankaj Tripathi), his nephew and Ramadhir Singh where the two decide to become allies against their common enemy, Sardar. Sultan asks Ramadhir for modern automatic weapons which the latter promises to give. 1990s Sardar becomes the most feared man in Wasseypur and shifts his business to stealing iron ore. Danish Khan (Vineet Kumar Singh) joins the family business. A failed attack from Sultan Qureshi leaves Danish with a minor injury and causes reconciliation between Sardar and Nagma. Sardar finds Ramadhir and warns him of terrible consequences if anything ever happens to his family. A mature Faizal (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is seriously affected by Bollywood movies as he starts behaving, talking and dressing like Bollywood characters. Sardar sends Faizal to Varanasi to buy guns, but Faizal is caught by the police and jailed. Upon release, he kills the gun seller Yadav, who unbeknownst to Faizal was the nameless assassin who had killed Shahid Khan (Faizal's grandfather) and who had implicated Faizal to police earlier. Meanwhile, Sardar seizes a lake belonging to a local temple and charges commission on fish sellers who make a catch in that lake. An uneasy peace is maintained between the Qureshi and Khan families when Danish Khan marries Shama Parveen, the sister of Sultan Qureshi. At the same time, Faizal begins romancing Mohsina Hamid (Huma Qureshi), another kin of Sultan. Epilogue Faizal reveals to his friend, Faizlu that his father Sardar would be travelling without security the next day. Unbeknownst to Faizal, Faizlu is actually an ally of Sultan. Late that night, while Faizal is still asleep, Faizlu calls up the Qureshis and tells them that Sardar's bodyguards wouldn't be with him the next day. The next morning, Sardar leaves home alone and reaches Durga's house where he gives her her expense allowance. Once Sardar leaves, Durga also calls up the Qureshis and tells them that he has just left her house. The Qureshi men follow Sardar's car, and when the latter stops at a petrol pump to refuel they start shooting as Sardar ducks in the car for cover. The Qureshi men put several close rounds through the car window ensuring a precise and unmistakable hit, after which they escape. A shocked Sardar opens the car door and stands up to reveal multiple bullet wounds, with one bullet embedded in his head. He steps out with his gun drawn to stop a cycle ferry on which he eventually collapses to his death.",

The exercise was popularized when the United States Armed Services made it one of the ways used to assess the fitness level of recruits when the US entered World War II. Although the original test was not designed to be performed at high volume, the Army used the burpee to test how many times it can be performed by a soldier in 20 seconds eight burpees in 20 seconds is considered poor, 10 is fair, 13 or more excellent. The Army also considered that a soldier fit enough for the rigor of war should be able to perform 40 or 50 burpees non-stop in an easy rhythm.",

The origins of Butter Chicken can be traced back to the Mughal era when it was known as Murgh Makhani. It was a favorite dish of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who loved the combination of tender chicken cooked in a rich tomato-based gravy. Over time, the dish evolved to become the Butter Chicken we know and love today.The dish is typically made by marinating chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and lemon juice. The chicken is then grilled or roasted until it is cooked through and has a slightly charred exterior. The tomato-based sauce is made by sautÃ©ing onions and garlic in butter, adding tomatoes, and simmering until it thickens. Cream is added to give the sauce its rich, creamy texture. Butter Chicken is best enjoyed with naan, a traditional Indian bread made from flour, yeast, and water. The bread is cooked in a tandoor oven, which gives it its distinctive charred flavor. The bread is perfect for scooping up the sauce and tender chicken pieces. If you're looking to make Butter Chicken at home, there are many recipes available online. It can be a bit time-consuming to prepare, but the end result is worth it. The dish is perfect for a special occasion or when you're looking to impress your guests with your culinary skills.

        description:"Rogan Josh is a popular Kashmiri dish that has become famous all over India and the world. It is a rich, aromatic lamb curry that is cooked with a blend of Kashmiri spices and yogurt. Let's dive deeper into the history, ingredients, and preparation of this delicious dish.\n\nHistory\n\nRogan Josh has its origins in the Kashmir Valley, located in the northern part of India. The word 'Rogan Josh' is derived from two Persian words - 'Rogan' meaning oil and 'Josh' meaning heat or passion. The dish is said to have been brought to India by the Mughals, who ruled the country from the 16th to the 19th century.\n\n Ingredients \n\nThe main ingredient of Rogan Josh is lamb, which is slow-cooked in a blend of spices and yogurt until it becomes tender and succulent. The spices used in the dish include Kashmiri chili powder, which gives the curry its signature bright red color, as well as ginger, garlic, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. The dish is also known for its use of a special type of dried red chili, called 'Kashmiri Lal Mirch,' which is milder than other types of chili and imparts a deep red color to the dish without making it too spicy. \n\nPreparation\n\nTo prepare Rogan Josh, the lamb is marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices for several hours, which helps to tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor. The marinated lamb is then slow-cooked in a tomato-based sauce with more spices and a generous amount of oil, which gives the curry its rich, silky texture.\n\n The dish is usually served with rice or naan bread and garnished with fresh coriander leaves or fried onions. It is often enjoyed on special occasions, such as weddings and festivals, but can also be found in many restaurants and homes throughout India and beyond. \n\nConclusion\n\nRogan Josh is a delicious and flavorful dish that is enjoyed by people all over the world. Its origins in Kashmir and the use of special spices and ingredients give it a unique taste and character that sets it apart from other curries.

        heading:"From Farmers' Food to Festival Favorite: The History of Litti Chokha in Bihar",
        description: "Litti Chokha is a popular dish from the state of Bihar in East India. It is a traditional dish that is enjoyed by people from all walks of life and is a staple food in many households. In this blog, we will explore the history, ingredients, preparation, and cultural significance of Litti Chokha.\n\nHistory\n\nLitti Chokha has its roots in the rural areas of Bihar, where it was commonly eaten by farmers and laborers as a quick and filling meal during their long days of work. Over time, it has become a popular dish throughout the state and beyond, and is now widely enjoyed by people from all walks of life.\n\n Ingredients\n\nLitti Chokha is made from a few simple ingredients, most of which are easily found in any Indian kitchen. The main ingredients are:\n\nSattu: Sattu is a flour made from roasted gram or chana dal. It is high in protein and is the main ingredient in the filling for the litti.\n\nWhole wheat flour: This is used to make the outer shell of the litti.\n\nSpices: The filling for the litti is flavored with a variety of spices, including cumin, coriander, ajwain, and mustard.\n\nVegetables: For the chokha (mashed vegetable side dish), potatoes, tomatoes, and eggplant are traditionally used. Onions and garlic are also commonly added.\n\nOil or ghee: This is used to cook the litti and to flavor the chokha.\n\nPreparation\n\nTo make Litti Chokha, the first step is to prepare the filling for the litti. Sattu is mixed with spices such as cumin, coriander, ajwain, and mustard, along with chopped onions and garlic. The mixture is then kneaded with water to form a dough-like consistency.\nNext, the outer shell of the litti is made by kneading whole wheat flour with water and shaping it into small balls. A hole is then made in the center of each ball and a small amount of the sattu filling is placed inside. The ball is then sealed and shaped into a round ball again.\n\n The litti is then cooked over hot charcoal or wood fire until it is golden brown and crispy on the outside. It is then served hot with chokha on the side. To make the chokha, the vegetables are roasted over an open flame until they are soft and charred. They are then mashed with a fork or pestle and mixed with chopped onions, garlic, and salt. The mixture is then tempered with hot oil or ghee and served alongside the litti.\n\n Cultural Significance\n\nLitti Chokha is not only a delicious dish but also an important part of the cultural heritage of Bihar. It is often served at festivals, weddings, and other special occasions and is a symbol of the state's rich culinary tradition. In recent years, Litti Chokha has gained popularity outside of Bihar as well, with restaurants and street vendors in other parts of India and even abroad serving their own versions of the dish.\n\nIn conclusion, Litti Chokha is a delicious and nutritious dish that is enjoyed by people throughout Bihar and beyond. It is a testament to the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the people who created it and continues to be an important part of the state's cultural heritage. If you ever have the opportunity to try Litti Chokha, don't miss out on this flavorful and satisfying dish!",

It is a sweet and spongy ball-shaped dessert that is made from chenna, a type of curdled milk, and is soaked in a syrup made of sugar and water. Rasgulla is a popular sweet in India and is enjoyed by people of all ages. The origin of Rasgulla dates back to the 19th century when a famous sweet maker named Nobin Chandra Das invented it in Kolkata, West Bengal. He was experimenting with different types of chenna-based sweets and came up with the recipe for Rasgulla. The dessert quickly became popular in the region and soon spread to other parts of India. To make Rasgulla, milk is first boiled and then curdled using lemon juice or vinegar. The curdled milk is then strained and kneaded to remove excess water, and the resulting chenna is then shaped into small balls. These balls are then cooked in a sugar syrup until they become spongy and absorb the syrup. The finished product is a soft and juicy dessert that melts in your mouth. Rasgulla has become so popular that it has even become a point of contention between West Bengal and its neighboring state of Odisha, which claims to be the birthplace of the dessert. In 2015, the two states fought a legal battle over the ownership of Rasgulla, with West Bengal eventually winning the trademark for the sweet. Rasgulla is not only popular in India, but it has also gained popularity in other parts of the world. It is a favorite dessert among Indians living abroad, and many Indian restaurants serve it as a dessert. In fact, in 2015, the Indian government even proposed to make Rasgulla India's national dessert. In conclusion, Rasgulla is a delicious dessert that has become an integral part of Indian cuisine. It has a rich history and is enjoyed by people all over the world. Whether you're in India or abroad, Rasgulla is a dessert that is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.",

        description:"Thousands of people, including such familiar names as Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk, signed the open letter from the Future of Life institute earlier this week, proposing that development of AI models like GPT-4 should be put on hold in order to avoid âloss of control of our civilization,â among other threats. Timnit Gebru, Emily M. Bender, Angelina McMillan-Major and Margaret Mitchell are all major figures in the domains of AI and ethics, known (in addition to their work) for being pushed out of Google over a paper criticizing the capabilities of AI. They are currently working together at the DAIR Institute, a new research outfit aimed at studying and exposing and preventing AI-associated harms. But they were not to be found on the list of signatories, and now have published a rebuke calling out the letterâs failure to engage with existing problems caused by the tech. âThose hypothetical risks are the focus of a dangerous ideology called longtermism that ignores the actual harms resulting from the deployment of AI systems today,â they wrote, citing worker exploitation, data theft, synthetic media that props up existing power structures and the further concentration of those power structures in fewer hands. The choice to worry about a Terminator- or Matrix-esque robot apocalypse is a red herring when we have, in the same moment, reports of companies like Clearview AI being used by the police to essentially frame an innocent man. No need for a T-1000 when youâve got Ring cams on every front door accessible via online rubber-stamp warrant factories. While the DAIR crew agree with some of the letterâs aims, like identifying synthetic media, they emphasize that action must be taken now, on todayâs problems, with remedies we have available to us: What we need is regulation that enforces transparency. Not only should it always be clear when we are encountering synthetic media, but organizations building these systems should also be required to document and disclose the training data and model architectures. The onus of creating tools that are safe to use should be on the companies that build and deploy generative systems, which means that builders of these systems should be made accountable for the outputs produced by their products.The current race towards ever larger âAI experimentsâ is not a preordained path where our only choice is how fast to run, but rather a set of decisions driven by the profit motive. The actions and choices of corporations must be shaped by regulation which protects the rights and interests of people.",

        description:"Making good on its promise from May 2022, code repository GitHub is beginning to require developers who contribute code to the site to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on their accounts. The policy, which officially went into effect on March 13 this year, will begin with âsmaller groupsâ and subsequently expand to encompass the entire GitHub developer community by the end of the year. GitHub will inform those whose accounts are selected that they have 45 days to set up 2FA, after which any attempts to log in will trigger the requirement. Fortunately, GitHub appears to have gone out of its way to make the onboarding process as easy as possible for developersâwhich is important, given that user experience and complexity are some of the biggest hindrances to widespread 2FA adoption, according to Yubico research. GitHub is allowing users to have both an authenticator app providing a time-based one-time password (TOTP) and an SMS number registered to their accounts. The repository will also now allow users locked out of their accounts to unlink email addresses from 2FA-enabled accounts, making it easier for those locked out to start another account using the same email. Twenty-eight days after enabling 2FA, according to GitHub, users will also be asked to perform a checkup that ensures their authentication method is working properly. GitHub is one of the primary hubs for the open-source community, and the new 2FA requirements are coming into play alongside widespread concerns about the state of software supply-chain security and potential exploitation of flaws and vulnerabilities in ubiquitous open-source software that developers might not even realize is part of their technology stack. A recent Synopsys report on audited code bases, for example, found that 84% contained at least one open-source vulnerability, and 48% had at least one classified as severe.âTM",

Over time, those flaws can build up and open the door to vulnerabilities that can be exploited by threat actors of all kindsâraising concerns that adversaries have more lines of attack. âRansomware may be the one that causes you the pain thatâs most visible, but the underlying disease that was untreated is fundamentally the real concern that we overlook,â Wiacek said. We shall fight on the beaches. Undetected malicious software can be used as a âbeachheadâ for ransom attacks, but the fact that the threats can go so long undetected indicates greater problems at the core of IT security that need to be dealt with. Wiacek told IT Brew that whatâs required is better practices. âWhen you start thinking about this as a hygiene problem, the best way to stop ransomware is to make sure that you donât have compromised devices on your networks in the first place that can then be used as beachhead to get ransomware to show up,â Wiacek said. âThe ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.â Part of the threat landscape, according to a new Rapid7 analysis, is widespread exploitation vulnerabilities. Caitlin Condon, the Rapid7 reportâs lead author, told IT Brew that the reduction may well be the result of a more sophisticated class of cybercriminal. âWeâve seen that the cybercrime economy is mature, itâs specialized, it is geared towards speed,â Condon said. Reductions and reasons. Ransomware attacks decreased by 39% from December 2022 to January 2023, NCC Group foundâbut the 165 January attacks were still the highest recorded number for that month yet, beating out the same period in 2022 and 2021 easily. Hackers targeted firms in North America and Europe the most, followed by Asia. Combined, the three regions made up 86% of attacks. The NCC Group reportâs lead author, Matt Hull, told IT Brew that reductions in ransomware attacks and payments are in part the result of external factors like the war in Ukraine. A large number of cybercriminals are based in Ukraine and in Russia, and the conflict between the two countries has thrown that into chaos. âYouâve got lots of people that operate within that regionâ within Eastern Europe, Russia, and so on and so forthâwho have been displaced and who have been drawn into the conflict,â Hull said. Fixes. Ransomware attackers have been staying power in part, GitHub CSO Mike Hanley told IT Brew, because they target âwell-known unpatched vulnerabilities that allow those adversaries to take hold without needing to worry about having to have access to an expensive zero-day attack.â Thatâs a problem with a pretty simple solution. âThe solution to that is relatively well understood, which is patching,â Hanley said. âI donât mean to trivialize how hard that can be, especially in a big enterprise. Butâ¦I don;t feel like weâve made sufficient progress as an industry on things like that.â NCCâs Hull recommends a number of steps IT teams can take to address vulnerabilities. Switching passwords, practicing how to spot social engineering and phishing, and patching infrastructure are essential.âEH",

        subheading:"Twitter reveals some of its source code, including its recommendation algorithm",
        description:"As repeatedly promised by Twitter CEO Elon Musk, Twitter has opened a portion of its source code to public inspection, including the algorithm it uses to recommend tweets in usersâ timelines. On GitHub, Twitter published two repositories containing code for many parts that make the social network tick, including the mechanism Twitter uses to control the tweets users see on the For You timeline. In a blog poster, Twitter characterized the move as a âfirst step to be[ing] more transparentâ while at the same time â[preventing] riskâ to Twitter itself and people on the platform. On a Twitter Spaces session today, Musk clarified: âOur initial release of the so-called algorithm is going to be quite embarrassing, and people are going to find a lot of mistakes, but weâre going to fix them very quickly,â Musk said. âEven if you donât agree with something, at least youâll know why itâs there, and that youâre not being secretly manipulated â¦ The analog, here, that weâre aspiring to is the great example of Linux as an open source operating system â¦ One can, in theory, discover many exploits for Linux. In reality, what happens is the community identifies and fixes those exploits.â On that second point in the blog poster about preventing risk, the open source releases donât include the code that powers Twitterâs ad recommendations or the data used to train Twitterâs recommendation algorithm. Moreover, they include few instructions on how to inspect or actually use the code â reinforcing the idea that the releases are strictly developer-focused. â[We excluded] any code that would compromise user safety and privacy or the ability to protect our platform from bad actors, including undermining our efforts at combating child sexual exploitation and manipulation,â Twitter wrote. Itâs a bit of mixed messaging coming only weeks after Twitter fired much of its ethical AI and trust and safety staff, which was responsible for content moderation among other user security-related tasks. But the company nonetheless insists that it â[took] steps to ensure that user safety and privacy would be protectedâ with todayâs code release. Twitter says itâs working on tools to manage code suggestions from the community and sync changes to its internal repository. Presumably, those will be made available at a future date â thereâs no sign of them at the present. âWeâre going to look for suggestions, not just on bugs but also on how the algorithm should work,â Musk said on the Spaces session. âItâs going to be an evolving process. I wouldnât expect it to be a nonstop upward movementâ¦ but weâre very open to what would improve the user experience.â At first glance, the algorithm is fairly complex â but not necessarily surprising in any way from a technical standpoint. Itâs made up of multiple models, including a model for detecting ânot safe for workâ or abusive content, determining the likelihood of a Twitter user interacting with another user and calculating a Twitter userâs âreputation.â (Itâs unclear what âreputationâ refers to, exactly; the high-level documentation isnât clear on that.) Several neural networks are responsible for ranking the tweets and recommending accounts to follow, while a filtering component hides tweets to â forgive the jargon â âsupport legal compliance, improve product quality, increase user trust, protect revenue through the use of hard-filtering, visible product treatments and coarse-grained downranking.â ",

        heading:"OpenAI geoblocks ChatGPT in Italy",
        subheading:"No, itâs not an April Foolsâ joke: OpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.",
        description:"The move follows an order by the local data protection authority Friday that it must stop processing Italiansâ data for the ChatGPT service. In a statement which appears online to users with an Italian IP address who try to access ChatGPT, OpenAI writes that it âregretsâ to inform users that it has disabled access to users in Italy â at the ârequestâ of the data protection authority â which it known as the Garante. It also says it will issue refunds to all users in Italy who bought the ChatGPT Plus subscription service last month â and notes too that is âtemporarily pausingâ subscription renewals there in order that users wonât be charged while the service is suspended. OpenAI appears to be applying a simple geoblock at this point â which means that using a VPN to switch to a non-Italian IP address offers a simple workaround for the block. Although if a ChatGPT account was originally registered in Italy it may no longer be accessible and users wanting to circumvent the block may have to create a new account using a non-Italian IP address. On Friday the Garante announced it has opened an investigation into ChatGPT over suspected breaches of the European Unionâs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) â saying itâs concerned OpenAI has unlawfully processed Italiansâ data. OpenAI does not appear to have informed anyone whose online data it found and used to train the technology, such as by scraping information from Internet forums. Nor has it been entirely open about the data itâs processing â certainly not for the latest iteration of its model, GPT-4. And while training data it used may have been public (in the sense of being posted online) the GDPR still contains transparency principles â suggesting both users and people whose data it scraped should have been informed. In its statement yesterday the Garante also pointed to the lack of any system to prevent minors from accessing the tech, raising a child safety flag â noting that thereâs no age verification feature to prevent inappropriate access, for example. Additionally, the regulator has raised concerns over the accuracy of the information the chatbot provides. ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots are known to sometimes produce erroneous information about named individuals â a flaw AI makers refer to as âhallucinatingâ. This looks problematic in the EU since the GDPR provides individuals with a suite of rights over their information â including a right to rectification of erroneous information. And, currently, itâs not clear OpenAI has a system in place where users can ask the chatbot to stop lying about them. The San Francisco-based company has still not responded to our request for comment on the Garanteâs investigation. But in its public statement to geoblocked users in Italy it claims: âWe are committed to protecting peopleâs privacy and we believe we offer ChatGPT in compliance with GDPR and other privacy laws.â âWe will engage with the Garante with the goal of restoring your access as soon as possible,â it also writes, adding: âMany of you have told us that you find ChatGPT helpful for everyday tasks, and we look forward to making it available again soon.â Despite striking an upbeat note towards the end of the statement itâs not clear how OpenAI can address the compliance issues raised by the Garante â given the wide scope of GDPR concerns itâs laid out as it kicks off a deeper investigation.",

        description:"Ava Labs has raised a total of about $640 million, according to Crunchbase, and is backed by firms like a16z and Polychain Capital. In recent months, Ava Labs has announced a number of partnerships with major brands and companies, like Amazon Web Services, which TechCrunch covered exclusively. Ava Labs created the layer-1 blockchain Avalanche, a platform that lets developers build multifunctional blockchains and decentralized applications with a focus on speed and low transaction costs. The blockchain is compatible with Solidity, a language developers use to code, and allows them to build projects that can communicate across multiple networks. Hundreds of projects are a part of the Avalanche ecosystem, ranging from decentralized exchanges like 1inch to digital asset security firms like BitGo. In terms of total value locked (TVL), Avalanche is currently the seventh-largest blockchain, with more than $1.1 billion secured across a $5.72 billion market cap, according to CoinMarketCap data. The present and future of L1s is shuch that - The company sees its underlying tech as a key driver for developer attention. âLooking around I decided we have to come up with our own architecture for scaling that no one else seems to be pushing at the moment,â GÃ¼n Sirer said. Thus, a âmarriageâ of Avalancheâs consensus with its subnet architecture, which allows us to have multiple parallel chains dedicated to their own use cases, was born. âThat coupling was the genesis of what I thought was a brand new approach,â GÃ¼n Sirer added. Since then, Ava Labs has had one major focus. âThe north star for us is to digitize all of the worldâs assets on the Avalanche blockchain,â GÃ¼n Sirer said. âThatâs what we set out to do and thatâs what Iâm so excited about.â In recent years, a number of L1 blockchains have popped up across the crypto ecosystem, but GÃ¼n Sirer believes in three to five years from now the abundance of L1 blockchains will âbe played out.â âI think we already have way too many L1s and theyâre essentially copying other peopleâs playbooks,â GÃ¼n Sirer said. âIn many cases, theyâre bringing something to the market that the market did not ask for.â So whatâs needed to make a good L1? --- It has to be decentralized, secure and fast, GÃ¼n Sirer noted. âI think weâre in a good spot and I think people are going to converge,â he added. We also talked about GÃ¼n Sirerâs background, why he launched the layer-1 blockchain, Avalanche, in 2020, whether the space has too many L1s and how blockchains can scale more efficiently. ",

        subheading:"Battling over an expanding market for cloud services, the Big Three tech companies are looking for an edge.",
        description:"If your company is considering which cloud services to use, itâs likely that itâs the top brass who will meet with the cloud bosses, as opposed to lower-level representatives from your tech department. Thatâs what Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Adam Selipsky recently said in an interview with Protocol on data and cloud management. âThe cloud and our relationship with these enterprises is now very much a C-suite agenda,â Selipsky said. âThere was a time, years ago, where there were not that many enterprise CEOs who were well-versed in the cloudâ¦Now itâs actually something that theyâre, in many cases, steeped in and involved in, and driving personally.â Amazon and fellow top cloud-services providers Microsoft and Alphabet are competing fiercely to meet that C-suite agenda. So far, AWS is the clear leader, with 34% of global market share as of Q2 2022. Microsoftâs Azure platform is next, with 21%, and Alphabetâs Google Cloud trails at 10%. All three companies are seeing huge revenue coming in from their cloud services departments as they battle over the expanding market. Here are the ways the companies are trying to distinguish themselvesâand what executives are telling investors and the press. AWS and its âmulticloudâ bet: It is said that the internet effectively runs on AWS, so it makes sense that the company would guard that market. Not sharing was Amazonâs MO on working with other cloud services providers for years, but the company quietly shifted in December 2020 and now allows for cross-platform services. Thereâs an ulterior motive for that change in company policy. Selipsky told Protocol that customers will develop better expertise and see benefits of scale by sticking to one service. The implication is that this will become self-evident once customers see all services together. âIn general, when we look across our worldwide customer base, we see time after time that the most innovation and the most efficient cost structure happens when customers choose one providerâwhen theyâre running predominantly on AWS,â Selipsky said. Microsoftâs focus on saving costs: Microsoftâs Azure cloud platform is selling itself to customers as an energy-smart alternative to data-hosting that can weather the storms of an uncertain economic climate. During an earnings call Q&A in October, company CEO Satya Nadella told Mizuho Securities Analyst Gregg Moskowitz that the company feels the cloud services it offers allow for saving money because the âpublic cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk. âThe uncertainty isnât solely about consumer demand. Nadella noted that with supply-chain instability and rising energy costs, the benefits of Azure cloud computing for businesses that are looking to ensure the stability of data storage are clear. Googleâs cloud plans are part of its AI strategy: Just because Google Cloud services are lagging behind the competition, doesnât mean they are taking a step back. Instead, Alphabetâs tactical approach to the new cloud world is to use the data-management tool as a way to refine and expand its machine learning capabilities. It makes senseâAlphabetâs software is known for its strong AI, boosted by the omnipresence of Search and the popularity of Maps and YouTube applications.",

        description:"The industrial metaverseâa metaverse sector that mirrors and simulates real machines, factories, cities, transportation networks, and other highly complex systemsâwill offer to its participants fully immersive, real-time, interactive, persistent, and synchronous representations and simulations of the real world. Existing and developing technologies, including digital twins, artificial intelligence and machine learning, extended reality, blockchain, and cloud and edge computing, will be the building blocks of the industrial metaverse. These will converge to create a powerful interface between the real and digital worlds that is greater than the sum of its individual parts. Annika Hauptvogel, head of technology and innovation management at Siemens, describes the industrial metaverse as âimmersive, making users feel as if theyâre in a real environment; collaborative in real time; open enough for different applications to seamlessly interact; and trusted by the individuals and businesses that participateââfar more than simply a digital world. The industrial metaverse will revolutionize the way work is done, but it will also unlock significant new value for business and societies. By allowing businesses to model, prototype, and test dozens, hundreds, or millions of design iterations in real time and in an immersive, physics-based environment before committing physical and human resources to a project, industrial metaverse tools will usher in a new era of solving real-world problems digitally. âThe real world is very messy, noisy, and sometimes hard to really understand,â says Danny Lange, senior vice president of artificial intelligence at Unity Technologies, a leading platform for creating and growing real-time 3-D content. âThe idea of the industrial metaverse is to create a cleaner connection between the real world and the virtual world, because the virtual world is so much easier and cheaper to work with.â While real-life applications of the consumer metaverse are still developing, industrial metaverse use cases are purpose-driven, well aligned with real-world problems and business imperatives. The resource efficiencies enabled by industrial metaverse solutions may increase business competitiveness while also continually driving progress toward the sustainability, resilience, decarbonization, and dematerialization goals that are essential to human flourishing. The industrial metaverse will bring together the digital and real worlds. It will enable a constant exchange of information, data, and decisions and empower industries to solve extraordinarily complex real-world problems digitally, changing how organizations operate and unlocking significant societal benefits. The digital twin is a core metaverse building block. These virtual models simulate real-world objects in detail. The next generation of digital twins will be photorealistic, physics-based, AI-enabled, and linked in metaverse ecosystems.The industrial metaverse will transform every industry. Currently existing digital twins illustrate the power and potential of the industrial metaverse to revolutionize design and engineering, testing, operations, and training. Everyday life will be radically changed. The industrial metaverse will change how we can experience the physical environment and how we work, live, manufacture goods, and travel. It will help us solve real problems and make our world more sustainable. ",

        subheading:"Multi-die system or chiplet-based technology is a big bet on high-performance chip designâand a complex challenge.",
        description:"To say that semiconductor technology is part of the fabric of modern society is not an overstatementâit underpins everything from our cars to our phones to our home appliances.  In 2021, the semiconductor industry shipped a record 1.15 trillion chips, and sales topped half a trillion dollars worldwide, while thousands of new chip designs entered the market. A new semiconductor chip architecture, termed âmulti-die systemâ or âchiplet-based design,â will be instrumental in meeting this decadeâs burgeoning demand for processing power. Because this new approach will pose technical challenges throughout the semiconductor ecosystemâremaking how products are imagined, designed, and fabricatedâopportunities for innovators across the value chain will emerge from this shift. Business leaders across industries who identify use cases for these advanced chips will benefit from their ability to power unique and customized customer experiences. Few business leaders, however, are keeping pace with the latest developments in this arena. Multi-die technology is still an enigma to many executives. A recent poll by MIT Technology Review Insights asked business leaders about their awareness of this design strategyâand found that 62% of respondents are either uninterested, unaware, or only somewhat aware of this technologyâs capabilities. A few chip-reliant industries obviously need to keep a close eye on advancements in semiconductor tech: automotive companies, artificial intelligence firms, hyperscale data processing organizations, and smart device manufacturers, to name a few. But because advanced semiconductors are foundational to modern-day business operations, even executives whose functions donât directly touch technology should care about chip design trendsâincluding those that will define the sectorâs next chapter. Why semiconductors matter? --- While the global semiconductor shortage that began in 2020 had its proximate causes in natural disasters and geopolitics, its effects drew widespread attention to the fact that just about every industry relies on chips. And pandemic-related ripple effects aside, the silicon status quo has been in flux for some time. New technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), which require greater computing efficiency and performance, have strained traditional systems in recent years. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), customers have also come to expect intelligence in everything from refrigerators to lightbulbs. Innovators are responding accordingly. Our poll found that nearly one-third (31%) of business executives plan to improve upon their companiesâ existing smart products, and almost another third (29%) intend to add AI/ML capabilities to their products soon. Only 9% of respondents said they were not producing IoT or connected devices. This type of technology, however, necessitates robust edge computing and on-device processing, which requires greater and more efficient hardware performance. Complicating matters, the cloud data centers powering this compute shift are also voracious energy consumers. This is another area where traditional silicon is stagnating: sustainability. The cost of producing superfluous silicon is not just bad for businessâit has an environmental impact. And while thereâs an ongoing push toward net-zero carbon emissions within the semiconductor supply chain, the industry isnât yet on track to meet the emissions standards set forth in the UN 2016 Paris Agreement. An industry shift toward multi-die design could be part of the solution to these challenges. Instead of a single monolithic chip (âsystem on chipâ), multi-die designs consist of a collection of chips (chiplets or dies) linked in a sophisticated package (âsystems of chipsâ), which can include stacking blocks in a 3D configuration for greater density. Multi-die system designs are capable of supporting the rollout of AI/ML at scale, and they can improve silicon yields, reducing waste during chip manufacturing.",

In a Twitter thread, Wiz researcher Hillai Ben-Sasson explained how he was able to hack into Bing's content management system (CMS). By logging into Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure, he discovered that he could grant all users access to internal Microsoft apps. He then accessed a database of Bing's search results. From there, Ben-Sasson figured out that he could actually modify what showed up in the results. Wiz researchers also discovered that Bing was vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack and discovered they had access to sensitive Office 365 data including Outlook emails, Calendar information, and Teams messages. MSRC detailed security updates and shared recommendations for Azure AD admins and developers in its blog poster. The purpose of the researchers' experiment was to show that it was possible and share its findings with Microsoft. But it shows how malicious hackers could have wreaked havoc for Bing. 'A malicious actor with the same access couldâve hijacked the most popular search results with the same payload and leak sensitive data from millions of users,' said the Wiz blog poster. Luckily it was caught before any major damage was done. Microsoft confirmed that it has been fixed as of March 29.

        description:"Sattal or Sat Tal, aka seven lakes, is an interconnected group of seven freshwater lakes situated near Bhimtal, Nainital district in Uttarakhand. The lakes are located between thick jungles of oak and pine trees, perched at an elevation of 1,370 meters, right below lush orchards in the Mehragaon valley. Sattal is one of the few pristine and uncontaminated freshwater biomes in India and acts as true heaven for migratory birds. A cluster of mysteriously interconnected seven freshwaters, Sattal is located in the Nainital district of the Kumaon region. Sattal displays peaceful environs emphasized by the charming which will definitely set your mood to get up and explore. A great destination for honeymooners, nature lovers - especially bird watchers, groups, families, and leisure-seeking tourists. Sattal is located in the Lower Himalayan Range and is the effect of tectonic activities and the elevating of deposits amid the Tibetan and the Indo-Gangetic plains. The rocks are mainly sedimentary and quartzite. The area can be divided into lower Himalayas and terraces. The British used to liken the enthralling splendor of Sattal with the Westmorland of England. In fact, the British loved the area so much that during the colonial era, Sattal had a tea plantation area which was among the four tea plantation estates of the Kumaon region. Given that these beautiful interconnected lakes are situated in the Himalayas â you can bet there is a mythological story attached to the region! It is believed that in the epic Mahabharata, during his 14-year exile given by his brother â King Nala drowned in the water of one of the seven lakes of Sattal with his wife Damayanti. That particular lake, hence, is known as the Nal Damyanti Tal. The weather in Sattal lake is typical to that of the Himalayan region with the summer months of April to June enjoying a warm, temperate climate of 15-30Â°C. And winter months of November â February can experience anything from 10 to -10Â°C. Monsoon months receive a lot of rainfall, because of which landslides are expected. Also, the spring and fall months are especially beautiful with the perfect hilly weather! Best time to visit Sattal is during the months of March to May and again during December to January. On the other hand, travelling in off season is cheaper and youâll encounter fewer tourists. Best to avoid monsoon season. The place offers visitors a whole lot to do and immerse themselves in nature. Yes, the place has unmatched tranquility. But, the rough hills of Sat Tal also offer adventure-seekers a chance to indulge in trekking, biking, abseiling, mountain biking, rock climbing, night-trekking, nature trails, backpacking, angling, kayaking, rafting, river-crossing, jungle-safaris, and night-camping. Of course, you can also enjoy leisurely activities like boating and fishing at Sat Tal. Truly a birdwatcherâs delight, the biodiversity of this lake is unique and includes 500 species of natural and migratory birds. Adding to the charm further, more than 525 varieties of butterflies call this region home.",

        description:"Camping is one of those things that bring great joy in the simplest of ways. Youâre completely in your sincerest of elements and connecting with your most natural self. This joy is one that must be experienced to truly appreciate the magic. Add to that, cold weather, and youâre in paradise. However, in order to truly extract the best from this experience â there are certain things you should do that will ensure in a near-perfect trip. With mental preparation cards on the deck, now letâs move on to making the camping as physically comfortable as possible. The key to staying warm is choosing the precise outfits that will aid in shielding. For this, you must keep in mind the basics â a base layer, middle layer, and outer layer. Try to look out for insulation through a good pair of tights, wicking underwear, or long johns. Now with the layer of what touches you, the middle layer is typically what helps insulates. Find a good puffy down jacket or a synthetic insulated jacket to keep you warm. For the last layer â you should have something that is durable and waterproof. Also, keep in mind that your bottoms are not denim â those donât provide any comfort what so ever! Be in athletic clothes. You wonât be able to sleep if youâre shivering. Even with warm clothing, youâll still need a comfy and warm sleeping bag. Ensure this is as per your specifications â do your research properly. A good trick to keep in mind when purchasing a sleeping bag is to assume that the temperature would be lesser than expected. And, this way, youâll be sure to be protected â with wind chill and all! The key to carrying food is to ensure that you plan, plan, plan!!! Figure out the length of your trip. Now, figure out the items you will need and ensure that youâre carrying good nutrients with you! Also, make sure the food is not too heavy to carry and allows you maximum energy, i.e. the biggest bang for your buck! Nuts, granola bars etc. make for good pick-me-ups in times of need! In terms of water requirements â drink more than what your body tells you! In freezing temperatures, it is difficult for the body to signal to you when it is thirsty. Thereâs a risk for dehydration and you must always keep your organs well-fed with water. With essentials out of the way, now, letâs talk about handy skills you must possess when undertaking cold-weather camping. Learning how to build a fire can be tricky, especially in the hills. If youâre at a developed campsite that has a fire ring or grill, then it wouldnât be much of an issue. But, in the hills âthis might be a daunting task. Ensure that you mark the area properly and also that there is no risk of any forest fires. A few essentials to make this job easier are matches or a lighter, a waterproof container for your matches. If this is your first time building a fire, do your research ahead of time to know what to do so that it is done with efficiency.",

        subheading:"The valley is breathtakingly beautiful during spring when the Rhododendrons go on a blossoming spree. It becomes a fall land during autumn with temperatures bordering coldness and a winter wonderland during later part of the year.",
        description:"We all have that one person in our life who looks beautiful no matter when you see them. Dear Readers, Yumthang Valley is pretty much that person for you. An all-throughout-the-year place, it has become a hotspot destination. Letâs learn about this gorgeous place of North Sikkim in this Yumthang Valley travel guide article. Tourists from all around India are attracted to see the carpet of snow on the trees, road and around the river which is almost close to freezing temperatures. The natural bounty bestowed upon the state of Sikkim is beyond words. One can find Alpine vegetation of North America, Europe â all of it in Sikkim at various altitudes. Vegetation at each altitude is different â Yumthang Valley at an altitude of 3500 m is more of a sub-tropical broad-leafed Rhododendrons or coniferous vegetation. When I traveled to North Sikkim, I was spell-bound to see a flat valley surrounded by lush green mountains on either side, grassy alpine meadows leading to Yumthang River (a tributary of River Teesta) flowing in the middle of it. You can take a short walk to the river, sit on its banks and enjoy the beauty while having a picnic lunch. There are several shops selling hot soups, tea, Maggi and souvenirs near the parking area. You can climb on the slopes to view the wildflowers in the valley. During winters, the main attraction is a visit to the Yumthang Valley Zero Point â a place where snow is available aplenty. There is no civilian route beyond the Zero point. The location alters between seasons. It is usually just after Yumesodong about 13 km from Yumthang at an altitude around 4500 m. It takes around 45 minutes to an hour to reach Zero Point from Yumthang and is a separate taxi rate costing 2000 INR extra for the back and forth journey. When I went first, it was just near a bridge, another time it was several kilometers after the bridge. The route to Zero Point is very beautiful, similar to Zuluk route. As we gain altitude and take turns, a different perspective of the valley becomes visible. Soon, the green lands leave way to the cold desert-like snowy mountains that we often see in Ladakh. There are several make-shift shops selling hot teas and Maggie which is a must have at Zero Point. Enjoying the beauty of mountains on the backdrop of clear blue skies while cold wind brushes your face is something you will remember for a very long time. Since this is at a high altitude, please make sure you do not over exert yourself and take precautions for AMS. Just near Yumthang valley is naturally occurring hot springs. From the parking lot, a short walk leads us to an iron bridge. Crossing the Yumthang River on the bridge is a good experience. As I walk past the fluttering prayer flags, I see the full glory of Yumthang Valley. A few steps climb takes us to two huts (one for men and one for women) where water from the hotsprings is routed to tanks for convenience. One can take showers in the pipes or from the tank. Hotsprings are well known for their medicinal properties with high Sulphur and one cannot help but wonder at the natural phenomenon.",

        description:"In 1984, Kolkata created history by being the first city in the country where the Metro services were started. Thirty nine years later, the City of Joy created history again as the Kolkata Metro undertook its first maiden under-river journey through a tunnel under the Hooghly river from Mahakaran to Howrah. Metro Rail's general manager P Uday Kumar Reddy, along with other senior officials of the Metro Rail and the Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation Limited, travelled from Mahakaran to Howrah Maidan station on rake no-613, which crossed Hooghly river around 11:55am on Wednesday. Uday Kumar offered a puja once the rake successfully reached Howrah station. Terming it as a historic event, the general manager of the Metro Rail said trial runs on the 4.8km section from Howrah Maidan to Esplanade will be conducted for seven months, after which the Metro service on this route will be made available to the public. Uday Kumar thanked all the staff and engineers of KMRCL under whose efforts and supervision the engineering marvel has been achieved. Kausik Mitra, CPRO of Metro Rail, said, âThis is a historic moment for Metro Railway as after overcoming many hurdles, we have succeeded in running rakes beneath the Hooghly river. This is a revolutionary step in providing a modern transport system to the people of Kolkata and suburbs. This is indeed a special new year gift from the Indian Railways to the people of Bengal.â Commercial services on this stretch are expected to begin this year. Once this stretch is opened to the public, Howrah will be the deepest Metro station (33-meter below surface) of the country. The Metro is expected to cover the 520 metre-stretch under the river Hooghly in 45 seconds. Once the trial run is complete, Metro service will be opened to the public from Howrah Maidan station to Saltlake Sector V on a regular basis. This in turn will help reduce traffic congestion and people can reach their desired destination in no time using the Metro service. ",

        subheading:"Startups are upbeat about the growing opportunity, as they quickly fill in the need gaps",
        description:"Itâs raining ayurvedic products. From big fast-moving consumer goods firms to young startups, everyoneâs lining up ayurveda-based nutrition and wellness foods, riding on a spike in demand for traditional brews and blends in a world suffering its worst health crisis. On the one hand, Dabur Ltd, already known for its ayurvedic and herbal products, is witnessing a huge surge in demand for its flagship immunity booster Dabur Chyawanprash and Dabur Honey. On the other, startups are looking to scale up their businesses to take advantage of the growing clamour for ayurvedic preventive healthcare products. Dabur has already launched a slew of immunity boosters such as Tulsi Drops, Giloy-Neem-Tulsi juice and an immunity kit. More innovations are in the pipeline in view of the shift in consumer preference. But it is really startups that are most upbeat about the opportunity, as they quickly fill in the need gaps. Ameve Sharma, co-founder, Kapiva Ayurveda, and scion of the Baidyanath group, which specializes in ayurvedic medicines, admits that covid-19 has accelerated consumer awareness and consumer demand. But Kapiva, he said, was growing even before the pandemic.For a company that started out as a retail model to create a chain of ayurveda clinics, Sharma quickly pivoted to being what he calls a 'pure-play FMCG business'. 'We expect to touch â¹100 crore turnover next year,' he said, adding that there has been a rise in demand for his products in the past four months. Kapiva offers a range of herbal juices, powders and candies, gourmet honey and nutritional shakes. On the cards is a multigrain Kapiva breakfast, details of which Sharma is reluctant to share. âAyurveda is more preventive than curative. It is a lifestyle solution. We wanted to offer a modern take on ayurveda that resonates with the consumers. At Delhi-based Upakarma Ayurveda, co-founder Vishal Kaushik is also dealing with a surge in demand for its products, especially Ashwagandha, which helps the body cope with stress. The two-year-old brand is available at around 10,000 stores across 10 states and offers almond oil, shilajit resin and premium saffron. In the pipeline is Ayushkwath, a kadha (home remedy made from kitchen spices and herbs for cough and cold) recommended by the Ayush ministry to build immunity against covid. Surprisingly, figures on the size of the Indian market for ayurvedic products are hard to come by. Kaushik, however, estimates the international market, which is also turning to ayurveda wellness products, at $4.5 billion. The Indian market is growing at 30% a year, he said. With covid taking its toll, consumer demand for ayurvedic supplements has shot up and is likely to attract more startups to the space. Kaushik said all his vendors and suppliers are reporting a surge in queries and demand for raw material. The supply chain may see some shortages if demand spikes further. He also expects more private cultivators jumping into herbal plantations to meet this growing demand.",

        description:"Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni turned back the clock and smashed his way to a sensational 32 off 17 balls against Rajasthan Royals, in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday, 12 April. Coming into bat in the 16th over of the game, when CSK needed 63 runs to win from 5 overs, Dhoni and Jadeja added rapid runs, and almost took Chennai to a victory. Runs flowed in the final 2 overs of the match where MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja took Jason Holder and Ravindra Jadeja on. With 40 needed from the final 12 balls, Jadeja took 19 off the penultimate over. In the final over of the game, Dhoni hit Sandeep Sharma for 2 sixes in the first 3 balls, but was not able to take CSK over the line. Dhoni, playing his 200th match as the Chennai Super Kings captain walked into the ground amid huge roars and showed some stunning stroke play during his 12-ball stay. Dhoni's innings had 3 sixes and a 4, where he took on Adam Zampa and deposited him for a massive six. Dhoni's batting sent the crowd into a frenzy and all of a sudden put the visiting side under pressure, at a time when it was looking comfortable for them. However, things completely swung to the favour of Chennai in the final three overs, but Sandeep Sharma held his nerve in the final ball of the game, when CSK required 5 runs from the final ball of the innings. This was Chennai's second loss of the season, their first at MA Chidambaram Stadium. MS Dhoni spoke after the match and said that the batting order needed to take responsibility for the loss, because the bowlers had done their job well in the first innings of the game.",

        description:"A woman suffering from an avian influenza A (H3N8) virus died in China on March 27, as per World Health Organisation. This was the third case of human infection reported with an avian influenza A virus. All three cases were reported from China. Based on the available information, this virus does not have the ability to spread easily from person to person. The risk involved in the spread of the H3N8 virus among humans at national, regional and international levels is considered to be low. The 56-year-old woman was hospitalised for severe pneumonia and subsequently died last month. The case was detected through the severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance system. WHO, in a statement, said that the patient had multiple underlying conditions and had a history of exposure to live poultry before the onset of the disease. H3N8 has been circulating since 2002 after it first emerged in North American waterfowl. It is known to infect horses, dogs and seals. The H3N8 virus is a type of influenza A group of viruses that is commonly detected globally in animals. Influenza A viruses - H3N8 - are commonly found subtypes in birds, causing little to no sign of disease in either poultry or wild birds. The transmission of avian influenza viruses from birds to humans is usually sporadic and happens in a specific context: most cases that have been reported previously were due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. As far as symptoms are concerned, zoonotic influenza infections in humans may be asymptomatic or may cause disease. Depending on factors related to the specific virus and the infected host, the disease can range from conjunctivitis, mild flu-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease or even death. Gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms have also been reported but these are rare. The infection is usually the result of direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments. To better understand the current risk to public health, more information is needed from both human and animal investigations, WHO stated. While there is a vaccine against influenza viruses, there isn't one available or reported for the H3N8 influenza A virus. The health body recommended practising good hygiene by frequently washing hands or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer and wearing respiratory protection when in a risky environment (such as live animal markets/farms, live poultry, or surfaces that may be contaminated by poultry or bird faeces). Travellers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal faeces or other body fluids. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water and follow good food hygiene practices.",

        description:"Benchmark stock market indices began the trading session on a weak note on Thursday after a plunge in IT stocks, triggered by fears of a âmild recessionâ in the US. The S&P BSE Sensex was trading 57.93 points lower at 60,334.84 at around 9:55 am, while the NSE Nifty 50 was down 0.12 per cent at 17,790.65. The broader markets also showed signs of weakness, in line with the benchmark indices. Sectoral indices were mixed, with the Nifty IT index emerging as the worst performer after falling 1.71 per cent. Nine of the 10 constituents comprising the IT index fell sharply. This comes just a day after TCS report its Q4 results. Although TCS reported a net profit of nearly 15 per cent, it flagged concerns of deferred spending and near-term uncertainty in its banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment. TCS was down 1.71 per cent at around 10.15 am. Analysts said the unexpected weakness in the BFSI segment in the US took a toll on the companyâs results. Major tech stocks like Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech and Wipro were also trading in negative territory in the range of 1-2 per cent in early trade and were the top losers on the Nifty 50 index. While TCSâ results seem to have hit sentiments, a bigger jolt has come from a recession warning in the US, issued by the Federal Reserve. The US Federal Reserve has projected a mild recession later this year and it has further impacted IT stocks. But the impact of this on the broader markets was limited after positive domestic retail inflation data. In March, CPI-based inflation fell to 5.66 per cent, which is lower than the Reserve Bank of India's upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent. Meanwhile, Apollo Hospital was the top gainer on the Nifty 50 index, followed by Britannia Industries, Eicher Motors, HDFC Life and Nestle India. Among other stocks, AU Small Finance Bank jumped 10 per cent after the Reserve Bank of India reappointed its managing director and CEO.

The trailer was only shown to the audience and was not released online. Brie chatted to the press at D23 Expo and was asked if sheâll continue playing Carol in future MCU projects. âI donât know, I donât know. Does anyone want me to do it again?â she told Variety with a shrug. âI donât know, I really donât know. I donât have the answer to that.â Brie was speaking about the sexist criticism sheâs received from fans since she joined the MCU. Fans were surprised that the film was named The Marvels instead of Captain Marvel 2, though it makes sense since the movie features Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the title change could reflect bigger plans for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Turns out, The Marvels is also a new comic book series and is a âblanket term to describe superpowered characters inside the Marvel Universe, with the series intended to span the past, present and future of the comic book continuity that got its start back in the late 1930s.â Whether this will be reflected in The Marvels movie remains to be seen. The Marvels comic is a spinoff of a 1994 comic book series titled Marvels. The series is told from the point of view of photojournalist Phil Shelton and retold âmajor eventsâ in the Marvel universe. Director Nia DaCosta, who recently helmed the Candyman remake, did tease that The Marvels âdeals with specific, personal, sometimes sad things.â She also noted that sheâs had âmore [freedom]â than anything else sheâs worked on.",

Ahead of its premiere during the upcoming Valentineâs week, the veteran director has revealed that Leonardo DiCaprio wasnât easily convinced to come on board. The film which starred Kate Winslet as the female lead first released in 1997. During the Golden Globes Award, James made this intriguing revelation and recalled the conversation with Leo. He told Peopleâs Magazine, âHe didnât want to do a leading man. I had to really twist his arm to be in the movie. He didnât want to do it. He thought it was boring. [He] accepted the part only when I convinced him that it was actually a difficult challenge. It didn't surprise me, first of all, that he's made a lot of authentic choices going forward. And secondly, I never doubted his talent.â James further in another interview revealed how he wouldnât have been able to imagine Titanic without Kate and Leo. He told Deadline, 'I think about that casting Leonardo and Kate in Titanic. Leo, the studio didn't want him; I had to fight for him. Kate really liked him (Leo). And then Leonardo decided he didn't want to make the movie. So then I had to talk him into it. You think at any one of those places, if that had really kind of frayed apart, it would have been somebody else and it wouldn't have been that film. And I can't imagine that film without him and without her.' People quoted him saying, 'I spent a year researching because I wanted it to be as accurate as possible. I said to the team, 'Guys, I want it to be like we went back in a time machine and filmed what happened.â With a new trailer already live, Titanicâs re-mastered version will soon be screened in 3D 4K HDR with high-frame-rate.For the unversed, Titanic upon its release back in time went on to win 11 Academy Awards out of its 13 nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film stands tall as the third highest-grossing movie ever made with a collection of $2.2 billion at the box office. Other than Kate and Leo, the film also starred Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, David Warner, Victor Garber and Bill Paxton. ",

'The quote, 'He a labourer, that's why he's helpless or maybe he's helpless, that's why he's a labourer.' This sounds so good. What a great writing this movie got.' A fan called him versatile.

Generations of filmmakers have followed the Yash Chopra visual archetype .You see traces of in the East-meet-Westâ vibe of Karan Joharâs films ;the subtle ,underplayed display of wealth in Zoya akhtarâs  cinema; the foreign locations, which became ubiquitous in Hindi commercial cinema of the 2000s. âThese were films so rooted in Indian aesthetics, but against the backdrop of something more global. It was import export kind of thing,â laughs Mundhra. Under all this inventiveness was a formula that spoke of the Chopraâs keen business sense, and to their audience as it expanded beyond borders; and evolved, getting acquainted with a new kind of leisure and the idea of luxury as spending power spiked post Liberalisation in 1991.

A light-hearted dramedy starring Sunil Grover, United Kacche also stars Satish Shah, Sapna Pabbi, Nikhil Vijay, Manu Rishi Chaddha, Nayani Dixit and Neelu Kohli in pivotal roles. Produced by Yoodlee Films and directed by Manav Shah, the 8-episodic series will premiere of ZEE5 on 31st March and will mark the return of Sunil Grover after his last successful series on ZEE5, Sunflower. 'United Kacche' is the story of Tejinder âTangoâ Gill (played by Sunil Grover) from Punjab who aspires to migrate to a foreign land for a better life and is willing to go to any extent to fulfil this dream that he inherited from his father and grandfather. Out of desperation, he gives his ancestral land as collateral in-lieu of getting a chance to move to England and do any make-shift work but grass is always greener on the other side, and soon after moving to UK, he realises the difficulties faced by an immigrant in another country. United Kacche uncovers the story of many such Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi citizens who are not permanent residents of England and are thus known as Kacche. They settle abroad as illegal immigrants without legitimate paperwork, living a hand to mouth life on daily wages while constantly hiding from the authorities. The show beautifully captures the nuances and difficulties of these immigrants in foreign lands with a light-hearted comedy. It also takes you into the lives of people from different nationalities living abroad together and becoming each otherâs family. With comedy at its core, the series also captures the heart-warming emotions, dreams and desires versus the reality of living abroad in a humorous and an entertaining manner. Sunil Grover said, âAfter the success of Sunflower, I am happy to partner with ZEE5 again for United Kacche with the hope and anticipation that our audience will shower us with as much love for our new series as well. The title of the series is significant and conveys so much about the show and its concept â firstly, the series is based in London and so, we shot in UK extensively to keep the look and the feel of the show as authentic as possible; secondly, Kacche signifies an illegal immigrant residing in a foreign country without legitimate paperwork trying to become a legal citizen and thirdly; united also conveys the unification of all illegal immigrants from different countries and religions who become one family as they are undergoing the same struggle so even in this series, you will see an Indian man, a Pakistani couple and a Bangladeshi duo live together in unison. In a gist, United Kacche is a slice-of-life situational comedy with relatable characters and their everyday struggle in a foreign landâ. âUnited Kaccheâ will exclusively stream on ZEE5 from 31st March.",

        description:"The Indian meal is a complex and little-understood phenomenon. âTypicalâ meals often include a main starch such as rice, sorghum, or wheat; vegetable or meat curries that are dry roasted or shallow wok fried; cured and dried vegetable dishes in sauces; and thick lentil soups, with different ingredients. Condiments might include masalas (a dry or wet powder of fine ground spices and herbs) plain yogurt, or a vegetable raita (yogurt dip, also called pachchadi in south India), salted pickles, fresh herbal and cooked chutneys, dried and fried wafers and salted papadums (fried lentil crisps), and occasionally dessert (called âsweetmeatsâ). Indian meals can have huge variations across the subcontinent, and any of these components in different orders and with different ingredients might constitute an Indian meal. When a multi-dish meal is served on a large platter in north India, the serving utensil is usually made of silver for purity. A banana leaf might be the main platter for a south Indian festival. In either case, there are various small bowls for each dish. This kind of meal is called a thali and is named for the platter on which it is served. The meal is eaten first with a sweet, followed by all the dishes served simultaneously and mixed together with the rice, based on the eaterâs discretion. The meal ends with yogurt, which is thought to cool the body, and then followed by sweets and/or fruit. Festival meals usually end with a digestive in the form of a paan (betel leaf and nut folded together), which again has regional variations of style and taste. Rice is a powerful symbol of both hunger and want as well as fulfillment and fertility. Until the late nineteenth century, however, only the wealthy ate rice, and most Indians consumed millet and sorghum. Nevertheless, the powerful symbolism of rice as a sign of fertility for many castes makes it part of marriage rites. Welcoming a new bride to the family home includes having her kick over a measure of rice to indicate that she brings prosperity to the household. A traditional test of a worthy daughter-in-law is her ability to âwashâ the rice properly and to gauge the right amount of water it draws while cooking. Rice is still a symbol of wealth, and those families who have access to âwetlandâ where rice paddies grow are still thought to be wealthy and well endowed. Long grain scented basmati rice is Indiaâs most popular variety and is valued in foreign markets as well. Efforts of the Indian government to protect Indian basmati rice failed, and now two types of American basmati exist, a situation many Indians consider shameful.

So much so that he took to Twitter to call out the airline for serving such unpalatable food to the passengers. He was seemingly disturbed to have been served a snack that was cold, sandwich that was almost empty and dessert that was just sugar. He posted some pictures of his meal on Twitter and wrote, 'Wake Up @airindiain Nagpur-Mumbai 0740 flight. Cold Chicken Tikka with watermelon, cucumber, tomato and sev. Sandwich with miniscule filling of chopped cabbage with mayo. Sugar syrup sponge painted with sweetened cream and yellow glaze.' Sanjeev Kapoor even pulled apart his sandwich to show the minimal filling. The post evoked the emotions of fellow users. Within 24 hours, it has raked in more than 36K views and many comments. While some agreed with the chef and condemned in-flight meals, there were some who claimed they've had good food experiences on flights. Some people even suggested a desi menu for domestic flights.

        description:"Sandwiches are one of the most loved snacks around the world. They are easy to make, delicious, and can be slathered with flavourful sauces. Whether you're looking for a quick snack during the day or want to satiate those untimely hunger pangs, a hearty sandwich always comes to the rescue. The best part about a sandwich is that it is easily customisable and can be altered to suit individual taste preferences. Generally, sandwiches are quite affordable and won't break the bank. But at this New York restaurant, their signature sandwich comes with a hefty price tag of $214 (Rs 17,500). Yes, you heard us! 'Serendipity 3', an upscale New York restaurant, has relaunched its 'Quintessential Grilled Cheese' sandwich for a limited period to celebrate National Grilled Cheese Day (April 12). Although the restaurant has held the Guinness World Record for the world's most expensive sandwich since 2014, this particular sandwich had been absent from their menu for some time. The restaurant announced its return via Instagram, stating, 'We are bringing back yet another Guinness World Record-winning dish for a limited time only. This National Grilled Cheese Day (April 12th), S3 in New York will be offering 'The Quintessential Grilled Cheese Sandwich,' which achieved the Guinness World Record for the most expensive sandwich in the world, priced at $214.' Wondering what goes into making this record-breaking sandwich? As per Serendipity 3's Instagram, 'The sandwich is filled with thick slices of rare Caciocavallo Podolico Cheese, made in Southern Italy from the milk of the Podolica cow, who grazes free-range, feeding on strongly aromatic grasses such as fennel, liquorice, juniper, laurel bay, and wild strawberries, infusing the milk with these sweet aromatic perfumes. There are only about 25,000 of these special cows, and they only lactate during May and June, making this cheese one of the finest and rarest in the world.' That's not all. The sandwich is then toasted and its edges are coated in 23k edible gold. It is served on a high-quality Baccarat crystal plate with a Baccarat glass filled with South African Lobster Tomato Bisque as a dipping sauce, which is swirled with crÃ¨me fraÃ®che and truffle oil. Sounds delicious, doesn't it? For the unversed, this is not the first world record for the restaurant. Earlier, they had set records for creating dishes like the most expensive French fries, the most expensive milkshake, and the most expensive dessert.",

In fact, this is what we do to search for anything near us. This search trend was picked up by a Thai restaurant that cleverly used it to market itself. No, we are not talking about Google listings or ads. The restaurant simply named itself 'Thai Food near me!' Our first reaction upon seeing this was 'genius.' And that is exactly how the internet is reacting to the viral tweet that shared the picture of the restaurant's name. A Twitter user named 'gaut' posted a picture of the front facade of the Thai restaurant. The board above the front door is marked with the name 'Thai Food near me' in bold golden blocks. Looking at the window panes that are still taped and covered, the restaurant doesn't seem to be functional at the time the picture was taken. But its name certainly captured the attention of the person who saw it. 'SEO game too strong,' The Twitter post started getting traction as soon as it was posted and now it is viral with 2.8 M views and counting. Users are applauding the brilliant marketing idea adopted by the restaurant, comparing SEO marketing to Display marketing. Calling it 'genius' and 'brilliant, Twitter is hailing this innovative idea.

        description:"Weight loss is difficult, but losing belly fat always looks like an impossible task. Even if we manage to lose weight everywhere else, that bulge around the tummy doesn't seem to budge. We all know that abdominal fat can be a cause of various health issues, including obesity, diabetes and heart ailments. Hence, it is important to trim the tummy fat but in a healthy way. A good, healthy diet can help fasten up the process. We have brought to you some expert tips that can help you achieve your weight loss goals easily.      1/ Eat Lots Of Fibre: Fibre promotes satiety and improves digestion, which further leads to the processing of calories from food. Anjali Mukerjee suggests high-fibre foods like oat bran, wheat bran and jowar to be included in your diet.       2/ Avoid Refined Carbs Refined carbs can hamper hormone balance and make it difficult to lose weight. If you want to get rid of your belly fat, avoid foods with refined carbs, - like cakes, pizzas, white bread and white rice. Instead, opt for healthier carbs present in whole grains, oats, brown bread etc.      3/ Cut Down On Carbs Post 40 Our ability to burn carbohydrates as fuel goes down as we age, especially after the age of 40. The nutritionist suggests reducing the consumption of all kinds of carbs - good and bad - by 40 per cent as soon as your turn 40.      4/ Eat Small Meals Eating less quantity of food creates a calorie deficit, which works well to burn calories, especially around the stomach area. Make it a point to eat smaller meals every 4 hours than eating large three meals a day. With such small diet modifications, you can attack that stubborn belly fat and make your weight loss journey smoother. But remember to consult your doctor or nutritionist before making any drastic changes in your diet. ",

There are other specific health benefits to strength and power training, such as better blood sugar control and a slowing of bone loss.  Strength training can help you build muscle, make you strong, increase your endurance and make everyday activities easier. Most adults should do strength training exercises at least two days a week, according to the federal activity guidelines. Beginners should start with exercise bands or light hand weights. If youâre more experienced, weight machines are a good option. (contentHelp:Harvard Health Publishing)",

        description:"By midwinter, our urge to hibernate can start to feel constricting instead of cozy. What better antidote to being cooped up indoors than a bracing hike in the crisp air outdoors? Winter backdrops are stark, serene, and often stunning. With fewer people on the trail, you may spot more creatures out and about. And itâs a prime opportunity to engage with the seasons and our living planet around us, says Dr. Stuart Harris, chief of the Division of Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. But a multi-mile trek through rough, frosty terrain is far different than warm-weather hiking, requiring consideration of health and safety, he notes. Hereâs what to know before you go. 'The challenge of hiking when environmental conditions are a little more demanding requires a very different approach on a winterâs day as opposed to a summerâs day,' Dr. Harris says. 'But it gives us a chance to be immersed in the living world around us. Itâs our ancient heritage.' A safety-first attitude is especially important if youâre hiking with others of different ages and abilities â say, with older relatives or small children. Itâs crucial to have both the right gear and the right mindset to make it enjoyable and safe for all involved. Prepare well beforehand, especially if youâre mixing participants with vastly different fitness levels. Plan your route carefully, rather than just winging it. People at the extremes of age â the very old or very young â are most vulnerable to frigid temperatures, and cold-weather hiking can be more taxing on the body. 'Winter conditions can be more demanding on the heart than a perfectly-temperatured day,' Harris says. 'Be mindful of the physical capabilities of everyone in your group, letting this define where you go. Itâs supposed to be fun, not a punishing activity.' Before setting out ---      (i) Know how far, high, and remote youâre going to go, Dr. Harris advises, and check the forecast for the area where youâll be hiking, taking wind chill and speed into account. Particularly at higher altitudes, weather can change from hour to hour, so keep abreast of expectations for temperature levels and any precipitation.       (ii) Know if youâll have access to emergency cell coverage if anything goes wrong.       (iii) Always share plans with someone not on your hike, including expected route and time youâll return. Fill out trailhead registers so park rangers will also know youâre on the trail in case of emergency.",

        subheading:"Flexibility is important at every age to prevent injury and maintain mobility and muscle function.",
        description:"Bend down and touch your toes. Touching your toes, like all other bend-and-hold moves, requires our muscles to stretch. âFlexibility is the amount of stretch that a given muscle allows,â explains Bryant Walrod, MD, a sports medicine practitioner and assistant professor of clinical family medicine at The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus. Every muscle in our bodies is made up of long strands of muscle fibers, or cells, bunched together into progressively larger groups and ultimately wrapped in connective tissue called fascia. Our muscles, by design, contract (which allows you to do things like move or carry an object or push open a door) and also stretch, he explains. And the opposing stretch is just as important as the contraction. âIf a muscle doesnât have the ability to sufficiently relax and stretch, it will change your bodyâs biomechanics, potentially leading to strain or stress on other parts of the body,â Dr. Walrod says. Eventually, a muscle that cannot sufficiently relax and stretch can limit our mobility. Mobility is the ability for joints (where two or more bones meet) to move through their full and healthy range of motion without being restricted by other tissues like ligaments, tendons, or muscles. When mobility becomes limited because muscles are too tight, the ability to safely perform everyday tasks, as well as exercises ranging from running to strength training, diminishes, explains Adam Rivadeneyra, MD, a sports medicine physician with the Hoag Orthopedic Institute and Orthopaedic Specialty Institute in Orange County, California. âFlexibility helps you perform activities of daily living and self-maintenance as you age, like putting socks and shoes on, taking care of your foot health, and being able to wash yourself,â adds Nicole Belkin, MD, an orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. Whatâs more, itâs important to remember that everything in your body is connected. So when one muscle gets too tight, it pulls on neighboring bones and muscles. And if one joint canât move like it should, other joints have to pick up the slack in order to keep you moving. Over time, this can result in overuse injuries, such as tendinitis.",

        description:"Quantum computing promises to provide a new way of storing and retrieving information different from the past's analogue and digital approaches. Quantum computing has the potential to make changes across industries from cybersecurity to drug discovery to machine learning; there are several challenges that quantum computing can tackle better than classical systems. Quantum computing has been the talk of the town recently. Many governments worldwide are investing large sums of money in quantum computing research as it increasingly becomes a strategic national priority for many of them. US President Biden signed the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act in December 2022, encouraging âfederal government agencies to adopt technology that will protect against quantum computing attacks.â Most of the security algorithms used today utilise the slowness of classical computers. However, a powerful quantum computer can break these algorithms easily, which may put sensitive data at risk. The field of quantum computing is still in its infancy, and the existing quantum computers are not powerful enough to threaten cybersecurity. Leading experts in the field forecast that the quantum threat will materialise within five to ten years. However, this timeline could be even shorter, given the asymmetry of information and secrecy across the globe regarding advancements in quantum computing by certain governments looking for strategic advantage. The quantum threat is already here in the form of âstore now, decrypt laterâ (SNDL) attacks. Adversaries are already harvesting encrypted data and storing it to decrypt when quantum computers and an advanced algorithm are available. Governments worldwide see this as a severe threat to the security of their data. Insurance companies need to keep their data longer, so they are already in the purview of an SNDL attack. In addition, many insurance companies underwrite cyber risks, and SNDL attacks will also be a concern from the product-offering perspective. One of the co-authors of the paper is Jack Hidary, founder and CEO of Sandbox AQ, a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider focused on bringing together quantum computing and artificial intelligence technology to address complex processing issues. The primary processing issue it is dedicated to is helping organizations understand the risk of quantum computing by identifying critical data assets that are encrypted and developing a strategy to protect them with the forthcoming PQC algorithms. The first thing companies must do is undergo a discovery process to determine the value of all their data, particularly information that is encrypted. For example, a large pharmaceutical company could have IP for patented drugs that are worth billions of dollars per year in revenues and royalties. If that data were to end up in the wrong hands, it could render that IP worthless, Hidary warns.",

        description:"In a bid to reduce software supply chain risks in the open source software ecosystem, Google launched a free API service providing dependency data and security-related information on over 5 million software components across different programming languages. Attackers are increasingly injecting malicious code into widely used open source components or dependencies to compromise software projects. According to Mandiantâs M-Trends 2022 report, 17% of all security breaches start with a supply chain attack. This attack vector is the second most common method used. The most common is using exploits targeting vulnerabilities in code. The free deps.dev API allows developers to find out information about the packages they are thinking of using, such as what versions are available, software license being used, and which dependencies are included in the package. The information comes from the security metadata collected by Google's Open Source Insights team. The metadata comes from multiple sources for 5 million packages with 50 million versions found in the Go, Maven (Java), PyPI (Python), npm (JavaScript), and Cargo (Rust) public registries.The metadata includes transitive dependency graphs, license information, security advisory impact reports, and OpenSSF Security Scorecard information. Support for NuGet (.NET framework) packages is on the roadmap, Google said. 'Software supply chain security is hard, but itâs in all our interests to make it easier,' the Google Open Source Security Team said in a blog post. 'Every day, Google works hard to create a safer internet, and weâre proud to be releasing this API to help do just that and make this data universally accessible and useful to everyone.' As part of the companyâs efforts to improve open source software security, Google Cloud also announced general availability for the Assured Open Source Software (Assured OSS) service for Java and Python ecosystems. Assured OSS allows organizations to incorporate the same open source packages Google secures and uses into their own developer workflows. When the service was originally announced in May 2022, it launched with 278 packages. Now it contains over 1,000 Java and Python packages, including projects such as TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Using this service would help reduce risk as Google is actively scanning these packages to find and fix vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are fixed and âquickly contributed back upstream to limit the exposure time and blast radius,â Google Cloudâs group product manager of security and privacy Andy Chang wrote in the announcement. The service provides Assured SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials) so that organizations know what dependencies are included in those packages. That way, if a vulnerability is disclosed in a dependency, organizations using the service would have a easier time finding out if they are impacted, even if the dependency is buried deep down in the software.

Cranium's 'end-to-end AI security and trust platform' straddles two areas â MLOps (machine learning operations) and cybersecurity â and provides visibility into AI security and supply chain risks. 'Fundamentally, data scientists don't understand the cybersecurity risks of AI, and cyber professionals don't understand data science the way they understand other topics in technology,' says Jonathan Dambrot, former KPMG partner and founder and CEO of Cranium. He says there is a wide gulf of understanding between data scientists and cybersecurity professionals, similar to the gap that often exists between development teams and cybersecurity staff. With Cranium, key AI life-cycle stakeholders will have a common operating picture across teams to improve visibility and collaboration, the company says. The platform captures both in-development and deployed AI pipelines, including associated assets involved throughout the AI life cycle. Cranium quantifies the organization's AI security risk and establishes continuous monitoring. Customers will be able to establish an AI security framework, providing data science and security teams with a foundation for building a proactive and holistic AI security program. To keep data and systems secure, Cranium maps the AI pipelines, validates their security, and monitors for adversarial threats. The technology integrates with existing environments to allow organizations to test, train, and deploy their AI models without changing workflow, the company says. In addition, security teams can use Cranium's playbook alongside the software to protect their AI systems and adhere to existing US and EU regulatory standards. With Cranium's launch, KPMG is tapping into growing concerns about adversarial AI â the practice of modifying AI systems that have been intentionally manipulated or attacked to produce incorrect or harmful results. For example, an autonomous vehicle that has been manipulated could cause a serious accident, or a facial recognition system that has been attacked could misidentify individuals and lead to false arrests. These attacks can come from a variety of sources, including malicious actors, and could be used to spread disinformation, conduct cyberattacks, or commit other types of crimes. Cranium is not the only company looking at protecting AI applications from adversarial AI attacks. Competitors such as HiddenLayer and Picus are already working on tools to detect and prevent AI attacks.",

        description:"Researchers have designed a 3D-patterned, graphene-based, dry sensor that can measure the brainâs electrical activity without relying on conductive gels. The dry sensors are less irritating and allergenic compared to traditional âwetâ sensors used in electroencephalography (EEG) to diagnose neurological disorders or control external devices through brain-machine interfaces. When incorporated into an elastic headband and used with an augmented reality headset, the dry sensors enabled hands-free control of a robot by interpreting brain signals. Although not as effective as wet sensors yet, this development marks progress toward easily implemented, non-invasive brain-machine interfaces. It sounds like something from science fiction: Don a specialized, electronic headband and control a robot using your mind. But now, recent research published in ACS Applied Nano Materials has taken a step toward making this a reality. By designing a special, 3D-patterned structure that doesnât rely on sticky conductive gels, the team has created âdryâ sensors that can measure the brainâs electrical activity, even amidst hair and the bumps and curves of the head. Physicians monitor electrical signals from the brain with electroencephalography (EEG), in which specialized electrodes are either implanted into or placed on the surface of the head. EEG helps diagnose neurological disorders, but it can also be incorporated into âbrain-machine interfaces,â which use brain waves to control an external device, such as a prosthetic limb, robot, or even a video game. Most non-invasive versions involve the use of âwetâ sensors, which are stuck onto the head with a gloopy gel that can irritate the scalp and sometimes trigger allergic reactions. As an alternative, researchers have been developing âdryâ sensors that donât require gels, but thus far none have worked as well as the gold-standard wet variety. Although nanomaterials like graphene could be a suitable option, their flat and typically flaky nature makes them incompatible with the uneven curves of the human head, particularly over long periods. So, Francesca Iacopi and colleagues wanted to create a 3D, graphene-based sensor based on polycrystalline graphene that could accurately monitor brain activity without any stickiness. The team created several 3D graphene-coated structures with different shapes and patterns, each around 10 Âµm thick. Of the shapes tested, a hexagonal pattern worked the best on the curvy, hairy surface of the occipital region â the spot at the base of the head where the brainâs visual cortex is located. The team incorporated eight of these sensors into an elastic headband, which held them against the back of the head. When combined with an augmented reality headset displaying visual cues, the electrodes could detect which cue was being viewed, then work with a computer to interpret the signals into commands that controlled the motion of a four-legged robot â completely hands-free.",

        description:"Scientists at KAUST have demonstrated a simple method of modifying compact semiconductor lasers to make them more suitable for illumination and holography. Semiconductor technology enables all components of a laser to be compactly packaged into a device that is only a few micrometers in size. This includes an optically active region that amplifies light and highly reflective mirrors on both sides. One such device is the vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser, or VCSEL. These are built by precisely placing, or growing, alternating layers of semiconductor on a substrate to create a highly reflective stack. The active material is then grown on top, followed by a second reflective stack. Laser light can then be emitted from the top of the device. VCSELs are advantageous because hundreds can be created and used on the same substrate at the same time. But the beam is prone to a speckle-like profile, which makes it unsuitable for applications such as lighting, holography, projection, and displays. These require uniform light in the plane perpendicular to the direction of beam propagation. The speckles originate from the highly ordered nature of the cavity, which allows only a small number of modes, or light-ray trajectories, to be emitted. âVCSELs utilize an ordered cavity that allows the resonance of light in only a small number of modes with exceptionally high efficiency,â explains researcher Omar Alkhazragi. âThe photons in these modes interfere with each other, resulting in speckles and low illumination quality.â Alkhazragi and KAUST colleagues, together with co-workers from China, have shown that speckles can be reduced in laser light from VCSELs simply by changing the shape of the device to break the symmetry of the cavity. This introduces chaotic behavior in the generated light and allows the emission of more modes.
